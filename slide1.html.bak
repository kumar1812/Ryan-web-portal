  <h1>Why This Matters</h1>
  <section>
    <ul>
      <li>ACL and MCL injuries are common in sports</li>
      <li>Injuries often lead to surgery and long-term damage</li>
      <li>Early prediction can support prevention and safety</li>
      <li>AI offers a new approach to injury risk modeling</li>
    </ul>
    <p>ACL and MCL injuries affect thousands of athletes each year, especially in high-impact sports. These injuries can require surgery and lead to lasting physical limitations. Our research aims to use artificial intelligence to detect early warning signs through an athlete’s movement and body data, ultimately helping prevent injuries before they happen.</p>
	<p>ACL/MCL tears are likely the unhappiest and most frequent sport injury, particularly in highly competitive and high-contact settings. They don't simply bench a player for a few weeks — they are likely to cause surgery, long-term rehab, and in an overwhelming majority of cases, lifelong restrictions or early sport retirement. Such injuries' physical, psychological, and financial impact is severe, not only for the player, but for teams, families, and health care networks, too.

Accurate and timely prediction of these injuries can revolutionize our model of athlete safety. With knowledge of risk prior to injury, we can shift from reacting to injury after the fact, to preventing injury in the first place. This is paramount in the maintenance of long-term athletic health, guarding youth athletes across formative developmental stages, and for professionals where physical well-being is a lifestyle. Predictive vigilance also advises coaches, trainers, and medical professionals in making the right choices, taking away the burden of guesswork, and preventing injury in the first place. Ultimately, harnessing AI for injury prediction is not about technology — it's building a safer, smarter world for athletes everywhere.</p>
