  <h1>Methodology</h1>
  <section>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Data:</strong> BMI, flexibility, strength, injury history</li>
      <li><strong>Motion capture:</strong> Cutting, jumping, landing</li>
      <li><strong>AI models:</strong> Random Forest, SVM, Neural Networks</li>
      <li><strong>Tools:</strong> Python, TensorFlow, scikit-learn</li>
      <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Accuracy, ROC-AUC, SHAP</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We will collect a range of physical and biomechanical data, including motion capture and injury history. Using this data, we’ll train machine learning models with Python and evaluate their performance through industry-standard metrics. Interpretability will be prioritized using tools like SHAP to explain how predictions are made.</p>
	<p>The project will initiate with the collection of a detailed dataset from athletes, consisting of primary physical and biomechanical attributes like body mass index (BMI), flexibility, lower-limb power, and history of past injuries. Motion capture sessions will also be conducted to record dynamic movement which is known to stress the knee joint—cutting, jumping, and landing—so that we may unveil subtle joint kinematics and kinetic patterns. This multimodal data will then be input into a collection of different machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Neural Networks through the use of Python-based libraries like TensorFlow and scikit-learn. Each model will be extensively experimentally tested through the use of performance metrics like accuracy, ROC-AUC, and F1 score to ascertain predictive dependability. Specifically, we will guarantee model interpretability as a key consideration right from the beginning, utilizing SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) in order to offer clear explanations for each and every prediction and an identification of features with greatest effect on risk of injury. This will allow us to guarantee the AI system is not just accurate, but also comprehensible in meaning as well as dependable for end-users like coaches, sports scientists, and clinicians. Approach is built in a fashion where it can be replicated, ethically considerate, as well as able to deliver actionable insight transposed into injury avoidance strategies within real sporting contexts.
