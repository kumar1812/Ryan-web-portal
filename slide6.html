  <h1>Ethics and Responsible AI Use</h1>
  <section>
    <ul>
      <li>IRB approval and informed consent required</li>
      <li>Anonymized data to protect athlete identity</li>
      <li>Minimize model bias and promote fairness</li>
      <li>Document ChatGPT and AI tool usage</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Ethical issues are core in the project and shall direct each stage in the work. Before data collection, we shall also get express permission from an Institutional Review Board (IRB) and do everything in our power towards participants' informed consent, with comprehension of how their data shall be put to use, stored, as well as kept secure. For confidentiality, all data for sport participants shall itself be anonymized, with secure storage, including robust protection against misuse, or unauthorized usage. We are particularly aware of the danger in bias in machine learning models, and shall intentionally do everything in our power for identifying, minimizing, preventing any imbalances in model performance based on different gender, races, as well as sport populations. Inclusivity, as well as fairness, shall also be monitored, regularly, during model training, as well throughout model testing. Further, we shall clearly note each application in AI technologies, including ChatGPT, among other generative technologies, for reasons pertinent towards academic honesty, as well as soundness, in our research practice. In going first towards ethics, transparency, as well as accountability, our project undertakes, in tow, not only for a better scientific foundation for injury predictions, yet also offer an open example towards how responsible AI needs must be implemented in sport, yet also in health research.</p>
