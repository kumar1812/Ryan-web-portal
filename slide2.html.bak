  <h1>Research Gap</h1>
  <section>
    <ul>
      <li>Current models lack individualization</li>
      <li>No widely used AI system for injury risk prediction</li>
      <li>Need for accurate, interpretable, and ethical AI tools</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Although sports science has advanced in areas like rehab and conditioning, there's still no mainstream AI system that accurately predicts ACL or MCL injury risk based on individual biomechanics. Most tools rely on broad criteria, not personalized movement data. This project addresses that gap by developing a tailored, AI-based solution.</p>
	<p>Even with advances in sports science, rehabilitation, and conditioning, there remains a significant lack of proactive identification of risk for ACL and MCL injuries. Existing injury protection procedures, to a significant extent, are universal procedures for screening, for example, classic test movements or demographical measures of risk. Even though exemplary, in a significant number of critical instances, universal measures do not address the individual-specific biomechanics, physical condition, and movement patterns for a singular athlete. As a result, there remains insufficient individualization in identifying high-risk athlete populations — until an injury results.

Moreover, there is currently no widely adopted, ethically viable, and sufficiently able for risk estimation for ACL or MCL injury, individually. There were prior works with case illustrations for sport implementations for AI, however, numerous models are either yet untested in a practice environment, highly complicated for practice implementation, or violate ethical standards for fairness, transparency, and confidentiality for patient information. There is a distinct necessity for AI technologies, interpretable, yet accurate, inclusive, and usable for sport conditions in everyday life.

This study fills that immediate gap with a physical-biomechanical data-driven system powered by machine learning tailored specifically for predictions on ACLs and MCLs. Integrating novel machine learning-inspired design principles for accountable AI, the project aims to go beyond one-size-fits-all protocols for screening, providing actionable, personalized insight with the promise of preventing injuries even before they can occur. Closing the gap in such a manner can potentially improve athlete protection, maximize training efficiency, and minimize physical-emotional damage from lower-limb ligament injuries in the long term in sports.</p>
