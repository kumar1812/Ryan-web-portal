  <h1>Specific Aims</h1>
  <section>
    <ul>
      <li>Collect athlete biomechanical data</li>
      <li>Train AI models (Random Forest, SVM, Neural Nets)</li>
      <li>Identify key predictors of injury risk</li>
      <li>Validate model accuracy and interpretability</li>
      <li>Address ethical use of AI in sports science</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The project has five aims, beginning with data collection and ending with ethical model deployment. We’ll use machine learning to analyze injury risk and evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy and AUC. Throughout the process, we’ll focus on fairness, transparency, and scientific reproducibility.</p>
	<p>	<p>This project seeks to build a sound, reliable, and individualized AI risk predictor for sportspersons' ACL and MCL injuries. We first gather a variety of biomechanical and physical performance data from sportspersons in a variety of sports and experience levels, providing a rich source for modeling. We explore a number of machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks, and train, test, and contrast models with the hope of finding out which approach provides the top accuracy and reliability. An easy objective is identifying the top predictors for risk for injury—aspects possibly which aren't immediately clear through normal screening. We test each concept with measures like accuracy, AUC, and interpretability so that results are correct, yet also useful for sport coaches and sports medicine professionals. Throughout research, ethical issues direct every action, including fair treatment for disparate groupings of sportspersons, transparency for decision-making, as well as data confidentiality, scientific reproducibility. In total, these objectives envision a broad approach for avoidable injuries' reduction, yet bolstered sportsperson protection through innovative, dependable AI technologies.
